Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Randoop

Advantages:
- random generation of arbituary values which might not be thought by humans
- fast testing as many test cases can be generated in short amount of time
- random sampling of the input space

Disadvantages:
- does not reach deep into the code
- does not cover semi valid inputs at boundary of valid space
- randoop test cases are designed to pass, therefore there might be undetected bugs
- possible high maintenance to randoop test cases due to large numbers of it
- Hard to understand and maintain the test cases due to the variable namings e.g. Boolean1, boolean2, boolean3
